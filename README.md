This repository contains the protein dataset used in my thesis on protein function prediction. It includes a randomly selected subset of reviewed proteins from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, filtered based on sequence length constraints.

Source: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Reviewed proteins)
Filtering: The selected proteins have a length of approximately 1000 amino acids.
